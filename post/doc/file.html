<h2> File Format </h2>
<p>

Input model file format consist of a header line and followed by node coordinates,
followed by elements description and finally data for nodes.
<p>

<h3> Header </h3>
<p>

First in the file must be a one line header. The header consists of model dimensions:
number of nodes (#nodes), number of elements (#elements), degrees of freedom (#dof),
and number of timesteps (#timesteps). In the same line must follow description
of the degrees of freedom with keywords 'scalar: ' or 'vector: ' (there  must
be the space at the end of the keyword) followed by a name for the dof(s).
<p>
Example:
<pre>
4 1 4 1 vector: Velocity scalar: Pressure
0 0 0
1 0 0
1 1 0
0 1 0
1 404 0 1 2 3
1 0 0 1
1 0 0 2
1 0 0 3
1 0 0 4
</pre>
<p>
The previous file describes a  model with four node coordinates, one element, four dofs / node
point, the first three being components of the vector Velocity, and the fourth scalar Pressure.
<p>

<h3> Node coordinates </h3>
<p>

Straight after the header begins the node coordinate array. The node points are given
a running index starting from zero. Even if the model is 2D there <em>must</em> be
three coordinates for each node.
<p>

<h3> Element description </h3>
<p>

The element description lines are as follows:
<p>
<pre>
GroupName TypeCode Index0 Index1 Index2 ...
</pre>
<p>

GroupName may be any string. TypeCode gives the element type:
<p>
<ul>
  <li> 303: linear triangle
  <li> 306: quadratic triangle
  <li> 404: bilinear quad
  <li> 408: quadratic quad
  <li> 504: linear tetra
  <li> 510: quadratic tetra
  <li> 808: trilinear brick
  <li> 820: quadratic brick
</ul>
<p>
Indexe0, Index1, etc... are the pointers for element nodes (remember that the
node points have been given a index starting from zero).
<p>

<h3> The data </h3>
<p>
The data must be given so that for each node there are values for every dof in one
line. This data array is then repeated for each timestep.
