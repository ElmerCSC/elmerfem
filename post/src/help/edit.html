<h4><a name="Colormap"> Colormap Editing </a></h4>
<p>

<img src=figs/colormap.gif><p>

Colormap editor lets you read predifned colormaps or define
and save your own colormap. Colormap is used by all the 
data displaying functions in elmerpost to map scalar values
to colors in display window.
<p>

Colormap editor is launched by selecting the menu item
<em>Colormap</em> from the <em>Edit</em> menu at the main
window.
<p>

When started the colormap editor 
gives an picture of the current colormap in a window.
The colormap indexes run from the top-left corner to 
right and down. 
<p>

A number of knot points are shown with circles inside the color boxes.
You can change a color of a box with a knot by clicking the box with
left mouse button when pointer is inside the box and using the 
slider at the bottom of the window. The current knot is shown with
green circle whereas the other knots are red.  You can also add a knot
to any of the boxes by clicking a box with the middle mouse button.
You can move a knot around using left mouse button to click to
a knot and dragging. When the pointer is above a knot you can delete
the knot by pressing Shift key and middle mouse button simultaneously.
<p>

You can view the edited colormap without closing the editor by
pressing the <em>Apply</em> button.

<p>
<h5> Colormap file format </h5>
<p>

In addition to editing colormap interactively colormap can be given
from a definition file.

<p>
An example of a colormap file is given below:
<pre>
!
!
! Default colormap
!
! code   index   red  green  blue
!
  knot      0     0     0     100  ! start from blue
  knot     42     0    100    100  ! to cyan
  knot     85     0    100     0   ! to green
  knot    128    100   100     0   ! to yellow
  knot    170    100    0      0   ! to red
  knot    213    100    0     100  ! to magenta
  knot    255    100   100    100  ! to white
</pre>

The file is composed of rows beginning with the keyword <em>knot</em> 
followed by an index to the colormap followed by red, green and
blue values of an colormap entry with this index. The size of the
colormap is given by the largest index to the colormap. The
red, green and blue values are given in percentage values from 0 to 100.
<p>
<h4><a name="Grouping"> Grouping </a></h4>
<p>
Grouping of elements is given in the <a href=file.html#format>element model file</a>.
Currently the only functional use of the grouping information is to
restrict the display of elements to selected groups. This can be accomplished
using the window given by the menu choice <em> Edit => Grouping </em>  shown
below.
<p>
<img src=figs/groups.gif><p>
<p>
A known problem with the display of groups is that it doesn't
apply to the line mode <a href=dspl#mesh> mesh display</a>.
<p>
<h4><a name="MaterialEditor"> MaterialEditor </a></h4>
<p>
<img src=figs/material.gif><p>
Material editor lets you change the surface color settings.  It has two modes:
<it>Ambient & Diffuse</it> and <it>Specular</it>.  In both modes you can use
the color sliders to adjust the color of the diffuse reflection and specular
reflection respectively.  The shininess slider is used to give value of the
specular exponent and thus applies only to specular reflection.
Lowering the value of the specular exponent increases the angle with which
the specular reflection spot can be seen to eye and vice versa.
<p>
<img src=figs/diff.gif>  <img src=figs/spec1.gif> <img src=figs/spec2.gif>
<p>
In the leftmost picture only diffuse reflection is used (the specular
color is black). In the middle picture the specular color is allmost
white and the value of the shininess setting is 20. In the rightmost
picture the shininess is 5. <p>
<h4><a name="BackgroundColor"> Background Color Editor</a></h4>
<p>
<img src=figs/background.gif><p>
The menu entry <em> Edit => Background Color</em> is used to set the
color of graphics window background. Use the red, green, and blue
sliders to set the color or pick one of the predifined colors in the
list box at the bottom of the window.<p>
<h4><a name="Timestep"> Controlling Timesteps </a></h4>
<p>
<img src=figs/timestep.gif><p>

The menu entry <em>Edit => Timestep Control</em> launches a panel that 
allows one to interactively view the timestep range read in from the model file.
<p>
At the top of the window is shown the current timestep as a number and a slider value.
Both can be changed at will.<p>
Below are the settings for looping over specified range of
timesteps. You can set the minimum and maximum timestep to be looped over, 
the increment of the timestep in between and also the number of times the loop is to be executed.<p>
At the second line you can give any Elmerpost command which
will be executed after each update of display has been done.
This option can be used for example to save the current picture
in a file. You can refer to current timestep as variable named "t".
The loop will be executed when you press the <em>Loop</em> button
and can be stopped prematurely by pressing the same button again.
<p>
<h4><a name="MathModule"> The Math Module  </a></h4>
<p>
<img src=figs/matc.gif>
<p>
The menu entry <em>Edit => Math Module Window</em> launcehes a text window
with direct access to the Elmerpost MATC- matrix language. Refer to 
<a href=matc/kirja.html>MATC-documentation</a>.<p>
At the bottom of the created window there is a command line input window
where you can give any MATC-command. The results, if any, are shown in the
text window immediately above, and a list of previous commands given at 
the topmost window.<p>
<h4><a name="StopProcessing"> Stop Processing </a></h4>
<p>
<em>Edit => Stop Processing</em> tries to stop Elmerpost from doing whatever
it is doing. This of cause requires that user interface loop is active at the time
(otherwise you won't be able to select this item), refer to TCL/TK documentation.
<p>
<h4><a name="CameraSettings"> Camera Configurations </a></h4>
<p>
<img src=figs/camera.gif>
<p>
The menu entry <em>Edit => Load Camera Configurations</em> lets you define camera (viewing)
settings. There are several parameters to consider. First of all there are
the parameters related to viewer: the point in space where the
viewer is located (From x,From y,From z), the point in space where the view
is focused (To x,To y,To z) and the 'up' direction of for the viewer
(Up x,Up y, Up z). Projection type of the camera, either perspective
or orthogonal procjection can be selected. The parameter called
'View Angle' acts like a zoom in a real camera: increasing the value gives
a wider view and also 'zooms out' the model. The range of view in
direcetion of the view can be set from the 'Near Clip' and 'Far Clip'
settings. Finally one can set the viewport i.e. the part of the graphics window
which is used for rendering this cameras view.
<p>
One can also read camera configurations from a file, an example of such a file
is given below defining three cameras on the scene. The cameras are
located at different angles with regard to the model and  divide the 
drawing area between themselves.
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
<h4><a name="ObjectClipPlanes"> Object Clip Planes </a></h4>
<p>
<img src=figs/clip.gif>
<p>
In addition to viewing clipping planes (see the Camera Settings previously), which are always
aligned with viewing coordinate planes, you can interactively set six additional clipping planes
in model coordinate space. The coordinates for the plane settings are scaled so that the
largest coordinate direction for the model is scaled to range from minus one to plus one.
