 1.2) Are there legal restrictions on the use of LAPACK software?

LAPACK is a freely-available software package. It is available from netlib via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web. Thus, it can be included in commercial software packages (and has been). We only ask that proper credit be given to the authors.

Like all software, it is copyrighted. It is not trademarked, but we do ask the following:

If you modify the source for these routines we ask that you change the name of the routine and comment the changes made to the original.

We will gladly answer any questions regarding the software. If a modification is done, however, it is the responsibility of the person who modified the routine to provide support.

1.3) How do I reference LAPACK in a scientific publication?

We ask that you cite the LAPACK Users' Guide, Third Edition.

    UMFPACK (including versions 2.2.1 and earlier, in Fortran) is available at
    http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse.  MA38 is available in the Harwell
    Subroutine Library.  This version of UMFPACK includes a modified form of
    COLAMD Version 2.0, originally released on Jan. 31, 2000, also available at
    http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse.  COLAMD V2.0 is also incorporated
    as a built-in function in MATLAB version 6.1, by The MathWorks, Inc.
    (http://www.mathworks.com).  COLAMD V1.0 appears as a column-preordering
    in SuperLU (SuperLU is available at http://www.netlib.org).
    UMFPACK v4.0 is a built-in routine in MATLAB 6.5.
