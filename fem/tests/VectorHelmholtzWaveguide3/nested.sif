! This differs from the primary case VectorHelmholtzWaveguide in using
! hexahedral elements and applying a nested iteration in the solution of 
! the linear system. The inner iteration depends on solving perturbed systems
! which should be easier to solve than the primary problem. This sif file is
! derived from the original file authored by P.R. 2.8.2018
