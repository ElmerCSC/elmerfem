! This case solves the electrokinetic case in the case when 
! the electric double layer is in the same range as the 
! thickness of the channel. The PoissonBoltzmann equation is 
! used to compute the charge density and another Poisson solver
! is used to compute the external field. The body force acting on
! the Navier-Stokes equation is then computed from the product
! of the external electric field and the induced charge density.
