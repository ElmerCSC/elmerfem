! A benchmark problem where an open hemispherical shell is subject to point
! loads. The reference results can be found in Sze KY, Liu XH, Lo SH. Popular 
! benchmark problems for geometric nonlinear analysis of shells. Finite 
! Elements in Analysis and Design 2004, 40(11):1551-1569.
!
! Here the problem is solved by using a high-order discretization over a 2-D
! domain. This option needs a special command "Skip Surface Reconstruction = 
! True" so that instead of using a physical surface mesh the surface 
! parametrization is described by the subroutine SurfaceBasis within the solver
! code ShellSolver.F90. Working without a physical surface mesh is limited to
! some special geometries which allow a parametrization by lines of curvature
! coordinates. There are other tests for general shell modelling based on
! physical surface meshes.
