! This case describes the flow trough a very small hole
! where the flow is effectively Stokes flow. Then a flow resistance
! may be defined for the flow.
!
! This case includes slip coefficient for the gas. 
! There is a variant of the case with no-slip conditions. 
! This is modern version of an old tutorial case which may 
! not be working anymore.
