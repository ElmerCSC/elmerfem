! This is a test case for checking the effects of curvature on capacitance
! The faceted geometries do not have same capacitance as curved.
! We may need to ensure curved shape at two accations
! 1) When "Mesh Levels" > 1 we need to set the added boundary nodes to the curved boundary
! 2) When "Element = p:$pn" where $pn>2 we must solve for a small linear problem to set the p-coordinates
!
! This case has also an analytic solution. Capacitance between two cocentric cylinders with radiuses a and b, b>a, is
! C = 2*pi*L*eps_0 / (ln(b/a))
! for convenience we define here eps_0 such that the capacitance becomes one.
! As the finite element tries to minimize energy we should approach the capacitance from above.
!
! This cases combines mesh multiplication and p-elements. Check for *CylH for pure h-strategy and *CylP for pure
! p-strategy.
