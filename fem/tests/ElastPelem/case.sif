! Test case for demonstration stress computation with p-elements in a simple 3d case.
! As the operator includes only derivates of shape functions the stiffness matrix may
! be integrated using reduced order Gaussian integration points which results to 
! significant saving of time in assembly. 
!
! The mesh is done with netgen and the original .geo file should com with the distribution 
! with the name HalfBallInBrick.geo
