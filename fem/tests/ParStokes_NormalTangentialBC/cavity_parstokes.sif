! This case repeats the solution of the other test case NormalTangentialBC, but
! here the solution is done with the special (ParStokes) solver for the Stokes 
! equations. The solution is done iteratively by applying block preconditioning.
! The Stokes system is discretized by using Q2-Q1 approximation.
