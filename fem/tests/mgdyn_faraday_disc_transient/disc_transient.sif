! This is a simple verification case to check that a Faraday disc creates
! the expected potential difference between the rim and and the axis.
! The same case is solved as a steady-state problem in the test 
! ../mgdyn_faraday_disc. Here transient analysis is performed using a sequence
! of instantaneous configurations. As explained in the following, this case is 
! also instructive to understand how Elmer treats Maxwell's equations in the 
! case of a moving body.
!
! Here a metallic disc rotates and is subject to a uniform magnetic field
! parallel to the disc axis. When the disc is put to rotate, the mobile charges
! of the conductor start to feel a radial force due to the Lorentz term v x B
! and hence accumulate on the insulated rim surface. As a consequence of charge
! separation a radial electric field E is produced. The process of charge 
! separation continues as long as steady state is reached such that the force on
! the charges which is produced by the Lorentz term v x B balances the force 
! which is produced by E. That is, in the steady state we have 
! 
!               E'(x) = E(x) + v(x) x B(x) = 0, 
!
! with E'(x) being the spatial field that describes the force experienced by 
! a charge (see Elmer Models Manual for Maxwell's equations in terms of E'). 
!
! Here the rotation is modelled by mapping the mesh at the previous time into
! the current configuration, so the (mesh) velocity corresponds to the velocity
! field as recorded by an observer at rest (the frame with respect to which the
! node coordinates are calculated). The spatial discretization is thus done over
! an instantaneous configuration. It should be noted that in the steady state 
! limit the scalar potential variable V of the model is related to the standard
! E field via
!
!               E = -grad(psi),   with psi = V + v.A,
!
! where A is the vector potential and v is the velocity, respectively. Note also
! that the solution is expressed in the spatial coordinates and attention 
! is not fixed on particular material points (this is known as the Euler 
! description in the continuum mechanics).  
!
! The potential difference between the centre and the rim in terms of the 
! variable psi is known to be 1/2 w a^2 |B|, where a is the radius of the disc 
! and w is the angular velocity. Elmer generates E'(x) as the electric field 
! variable and we expect to obtain E' = 0 up to the discretization error.
! To reach the steady state, increase the number of time steps (here the number
! of time steps has been reduced for quicker execution).
