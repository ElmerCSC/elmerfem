! Test case for 3D nonconforming mortar elements
! Some timing settings inhereted from benchmark computations
! 
! This case includes 4-fold symmetry in the rotations and 
! a skew of 20 degrees in the rotor. 
! Increse number of extruded layers for better accuracy. 
!
! This is a variation of the test case using strong version of the 
! Level Projector.
