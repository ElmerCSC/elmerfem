! A benchmark problem where an open hemispherical shell is subject to point
! loads. The reference results can be found in Sze KY, Liu XH, Lo SH. Popular 
! benchmark problems for geometric nonlinear analysis of shells. Finite 
! Elements in Analysis and Design 2004, 40(11):1551-1569.
!
! Here the problem is solved by using a third-order nodal mesh of the physical 
! shell. In this case all geometric information is derived from the mesh and no
! user-supplied information about the shell director is needed. At the moment 
! no numerical tricks are applied to handle numerical over-stiffness (locking),
! but the basic third-order approximation may give reasonable results if the 
! shell is not very thin. This approach needs a command "Mesh Reparametrization
! = Logical True".
