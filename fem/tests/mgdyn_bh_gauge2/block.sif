!
! The specialities of this case are that the consistently regularized 
! formulation for magnetostatics is used (ensuring a unique vector potential 
! solution) and that a block-preconditioned linear solver is applied to solve 
! the resulting linear algebra problem; see the second solver section.
!
! This case has been derived from the test mgdyn_bh_gauge.
