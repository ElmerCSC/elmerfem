! This 3-D test problem mimics a two-dimensional Cook's membrane problem corresponding to
! state of plane strain. With E=3, v=0.5, traction=5.0E-2 and assuming a neo-Hookean 
! material, the Y-displacement at the corner point (48,60,0) based on a two-dimensional 
! reference solution is expected to be close to the value UY=4.7011 [1]. Using this quite 
! a rough 3-D mesh gives UY=4.6933.
