!  THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS TEST:  
!
!  Solve the best approximation of the vector field U = (1+z-y,1-z+x,1-x+y)
!  with respect to the L2 norm using H(curl)-conforming basis functions. 
!  Additionally, compute the relative error of the solution using
!  the energy norm corresponding to the operator I - curl curl.
!  For the basis functions obtained here via the function EdgeElementInfo 
!  the exact solution should be in the FE solution space. This solver thus 
!  offers a consistency check for creating discretizations based on the basis 
!  functions provided by the function EdgeElementInfo. This test can be 
!  performed basically on any 3-D mesh if the element definition of the sif 
!  file is adjusted accordingly.
