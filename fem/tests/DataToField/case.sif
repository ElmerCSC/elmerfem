! Fitting to noicy or missing data by DataToFieldSolver.
!
! Example shows how to create a continuous field of a data that has missing or unusable values.
! The initial signal is a linear model f=x+2y. A trigometric noise in [-1,1] is added to this. 
! When fitting the field to the data only values where the noise is at [-0.1,0.1] is considered.
! The boundary conditions must cancel the natural BCs since otherwise the fitting would enforce
! zero flux. 
!
! The distrurbing thing with the current example is that there must be some piece of Dirichlet
! conditions since otherwise the results become unusable. There seems to be a severe sensitivity
! to the total flux being conserved.
