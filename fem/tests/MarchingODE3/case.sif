! Test case for MarchingODESolver.
! Structured mesh is detected in x-direction.
! We integrate over x and should get 0.5 as max value.
!
! Compared to base case this is transient i.e. we integrate
! one mesh size at a time.

Simulation
  Max Output Level = 5
  Coordinate System = Cartesian
  Simulation Type = Transient

! We would achieve steady state at 10 timesteps.
! Hence use less for the test to study the transient stuff. 
  Timestep Intervals = 7 

! This may be multiple of courant timestep .OR.
! large enough to give steady state marching. 
  Timestep Sizes = $h/v0

  Output Intervals(1) = 1
  Steady State Max Iterations = 1
