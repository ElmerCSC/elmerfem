! Linear elasticity of a simple rectangular object 
! Create the mesh with: ElmerGrid 1 2 winkel.grd
!
! This is derived from a cononical benchmark test with the 
! simplest 3D rectangular structure. 
!
! This case may be partitoned exactly to 4*8^n cubes. The number 
! of partitions can not be freely chosen here.
!
! This test case with Internal FETI.
