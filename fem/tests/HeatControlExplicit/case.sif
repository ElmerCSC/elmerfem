! This a test case for a system that depends on values of a control point.
! The control point is used explicitly. This takes use of some of the
! same routines as the implicite control but due to the explicit nature
! the user is left in full control how to use the control points coming
! from previous timesteps. Maybe a little bit different logic would have
! been ideal starting from scratch. Here we use the synergies of the previous
! control utilities.
