! This is a test case for cyclic system where results from previous timestep
! are saved for the next round. Convergence tolerance is the average nonlinear
! system change over the time compared to the previous simulation.
!
! As the base case but this one also with parallel timestepping.
! Paradoxically this converges a lot faster!
