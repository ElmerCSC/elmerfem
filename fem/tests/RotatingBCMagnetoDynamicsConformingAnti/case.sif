!--------------------------------------------------------------------
! Test case for 3D nonconforming mortar elements using the AV solver.
! 
! This case includes 4-fold symmetry in the rotations and 
! an optional skew of 20 degrees in the rotor. 
! Increse number of extruded layers for better accuracy. 
!
! This test case uses a generic projector for the airgap which does not make 
! any assumptions on the characteristics of the 2D mesh.
!
! For other BCs it uses elimination which assumes conforming meshes.
! Elimination is carried out simply by using permutation vector.
! Particularly With skew the elimination seems towork better.
!
! This case with antiperiodicity.
