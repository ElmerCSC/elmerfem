! A test case for Dirichlet-Neumann process for solving 
! a heat equation on two conforming meshes. 
! The case is not intended to be used as a real strategy for linear
! systems. 
!
! From the test case 'DirichletNeumann' this differs in that the 
! other solver is a master and the other a slave. This strategy
! is a babystep in robust solution strategy of coupled problems.
