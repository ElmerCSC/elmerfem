! In this example particles are falling one second under the influence of unity gravity field.
! As the particles are initially at rest they obtain velocity of 1.0 m/s in the end. 
! The information is used to constract a continuous velocity field from the data
! with the help of an auxiliary solver that utilizes the r.h.s. created by the particle solver.
! Periodic BCs are enforced on the particles.
