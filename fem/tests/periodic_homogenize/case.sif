! Compute heat fluxes over a unit square with a hole shaped like a cresent
! The results could be used in homogenization of a heat equation.
! The full square with the given gradient should give a flux of 1. 
!
! Normally the most accurate way to compute the fluxes would be the 
! "Calculate Loads" but this time it cannot be used while the 
! matrix includes also the
