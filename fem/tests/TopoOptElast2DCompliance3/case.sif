! Test case for topology optimization.
! Peter Råback & Stefan Hiemer, 2024.
!
! This case is the basic compliance minimization problem of a 2D
! elastic structure, see e.g.
! O. Sigmund, “A 99 line topology optimization code written in matlab,”
! Structural and multidisciplinary optimization, vol. 21, pp. 120–127, 200.
!
! This test case with
! - pde based density filter
! - this one is the same in parallel!
!
! Note that the test is not run to the end. Add SS iterations
! and resolution for better solution.
