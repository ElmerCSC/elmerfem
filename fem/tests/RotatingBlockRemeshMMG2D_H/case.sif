! This is a test case for remeshing after rigid mesh mapper.
!
! Compared to the primary case this is different in that the mesh
! density is given by a separate solver that is obtained from a solution
! of the ModelPDE with reaction term: Div(D*Grad(h)) + R*h = f,
! where f=R*r2 and h=h0 on inner BC and h=h1 at outer. This creates a
! nice refinement for the mesh. We can not maintain the boundary
! elements while honoring this. Therefore not remeshing the whole
! geometry is not an option for this scenario.
