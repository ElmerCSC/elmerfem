! Convergence control test case
!
! This is a simple case where the nonlinear iteration is only
! conditionally stable. With time the nonlinear source term increases and
! hence at some point we loose convergence.
!
! The type of control here is quite primitive one only measuring whether
! we have convergence or not. So it is not any fancy timestep control system.
!
! Without any tricks the convergence is lost with
! dt=0.1 -> 0.4 s
! dt=0.01 -> 0.46 s
! dt=0.02 -> 0.51 s
!
! With convergence control we decrease the timestep when control is lost
! Compared to adaptive timestepping this is more primitive since we
! just look at divergence vs. convergence.
