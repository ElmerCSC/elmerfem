! It is not sensible to perform too many iterations because the 
! iterative system actually does not most often have a solution
! Trying to find it will result to numerical problems. 
! Only 2 or 3 iterations could be optimal. 
! 1 iteration uses constant conductivity. 

  Desired Coil Current = Real 1.0

! In principle this could work to ensure smoothness of
! the conductivity field but in practice it does not.

! The fitting can be either isotropic or unisotropic.
! In the unisotropic model the conductivity is aligned like the
