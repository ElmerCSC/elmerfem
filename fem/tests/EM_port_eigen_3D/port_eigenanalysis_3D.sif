! This is a 3-D application of the 2-D test case ../EM_port_eigen. Here the 2-D
! port model is first solved over a surface of a 3-D mesh. Boundary conditions
! for the 3-D model are then created by using the propagation parameter and the
! corresponding eigenfunction determined by the 2-D solution.
!
! NOTE: This is WIP and this approach is not yet ready for serious use
