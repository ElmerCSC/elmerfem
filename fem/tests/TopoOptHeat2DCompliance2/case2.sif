!--------------------------------------------------------
! Test case for topology optimization.
! Peter RÃ¥back & Stefan Hiemer, 2024.
!
! This case is the basic compliance minimization problem of a 2D
! heat equation.
!
! This test case with
! - pde based density filter
! - passive regions included
!
! Note that the test is not run to the end. Add SS iterations
! and resolution for better solution.
