! This is a test case for checking the effects of curvature on capacitance
! The faceted geometries do not have same capacitance as curved.
! We may need to ensure curved shape at two accations
! 1) When "Mesh Levels" > 1 we need to set the added boundary nodes to the curved boundary
! 2) When "Element = p:$pn" where $pn>2 we must solve for a small linear problem to set the p-coordinates
