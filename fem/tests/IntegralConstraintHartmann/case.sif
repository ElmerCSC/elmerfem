! Hartmann problem test case for MHD. 
! We use integral constraint BCs to define the unknown velocity profile. 
! Iteration converges only with enough relaxation.
!
! This case was based on forum discussion initiated by Andrea_P.
!
! P.R. 15.6.2021

! Ha is the dimensionless number defining the effect of magnetic field.
$ Ha=10
$ visc = 3.925e-4

! Average velocity and width of inlet
$ vave=1.0
$ dy=0.03

! This relaxation factor needs to be pretty small to converge with large values of Ha.
! The larger the value, the smaller the relaxation factor.  
$ relax=0.2
