! Simple case 2D of sloshing as described in 
! U. Rasthofer et al., Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 200 (2011) 1866-1876
! An initial free surface is set and the time evolution of the 
! free surface is studied. The free surface must be smooth enough to be 
! described as h=h(x).

! Based on a simple structured mesh but could be unstructural 
! and more complicated as well.
