! Solver two ordinary & Poisson equations of the same kind
!
! We assume eq. -\nabla^2 f = 1 and -\nabla^2 g = -1 with {f,g}=0 at boundary.
! The solution is roughly max(f)=-min(g)=0.073...

! Then make a change of variables so that u=(f-cg)/(1+c^2) and 
! v=(g+cf)/(1+c^2) and solve for u and v with given c. The resulting 
! equation has cross terms with coefficient A12=c and A22=-c. 
! The f=u+cg and g=v-cf does not depend on c but the 
! difficulty of iteration does. Simple block schemes are stable
! only for moderate values of c (|c| < 0.5).
! 
! Here is a routine for checking the results in MATC of ElmerPost:
! math f=Tempa+c*Tempb    ( 0 <= f < 0.073...)
! math g=Tempb-c*Tempa    ( -0.073... < g <= 0 )
