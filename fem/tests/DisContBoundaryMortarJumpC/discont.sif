! Testing for the discontinuous boundary creation.
! Discontinuity is used just to create full insulation within a mesh.
! There is a 2D and a 3D case of this that differ only on the mesh used. 
!
! This is a modified test of the discontinuity that implements a jump condition
! for the heat flux. This case involves an absolute jump.
