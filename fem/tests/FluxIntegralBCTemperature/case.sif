! Solves a Poisson equation with floating potential (zero net charge)
! when Robin BCs are given. This problem is like having an well conducting block barried in an
! insulation without knowing its temperature. Compared to the "ConstantBCTemperature" test
! case this uses Robin BCs and finding the floating temperature is equal to finding the
! "external temperature" related to the Robin BC.
