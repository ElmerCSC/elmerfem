! This case demonstrates how to use outlet as the inlet for next
! simulation. We choose to use Gmsh format for the communication as it comes
! with the mesh + results in a rather compact form (and has other uses as well).  
!
! This generates a .msh file used to interpolate.
!
! v2 saves just the outlet
