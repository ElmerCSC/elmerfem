! Solve linearized 2-D shell equations of Reissner-Naghdi type in the case of 
! a straight cylindrical shell with membrane-dominated asymptotic behaviour.
! The problem has been described in Pitkäranta et al. Shell deformation states 
! and the finite element method: a benchmark study of cylindrical shells. 
! Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 1995. 128:81-121. Here
! the shell equations are written in lines of curvature coordinates (y1 = 
! angular direction, y2 = axial direction) and a special solver code is
! employed to handle the problem using the exact surface parametrization.
!
! This test provides a case for verification of the p-version of FEM.
! Note that now Elmer uses economic quadrature rules for element definitions
! "p:k" with 1 < k <= 8.
!
! The energy norm of the error for different p-element definitions (over the
! same 2 X 2 mesh) is found to be as follows (the shell thickness d=0.1): 
!
! p:1       Relative energy error =   0.88896260271790639 / Standard quadrature with 4 points
! p:2       Relative energy error =   0.29814339193540801 / Standard quadrature with 9 points

! Note that, except for the case p=2, the current version of Elmer doesn't 
! offer a way to obtain an approximation based on the space Q_{p} of polynomials
! of degree at most p in each variable separately, since Elmer doesn't employ
! the bubbles corresponding to Q_{p}. For example the p-approximation space 
! S_{p=8} of Elmer has 15 bubble functions and includes only Q_{4}. 
! A deterioration of accuracy may thus happen over non-affine finite elements. 
! The results above also show the error when the bubble augmentation 
! corresponding S_{p=8} is used in connection with p-elements of lower order. 
!
! For a very high p errors from floating-point arithmetic may limit the 
! obtainable accuracy.
