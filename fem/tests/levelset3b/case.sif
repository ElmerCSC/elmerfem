! A 2D test case for Rayleigh–Taylor instability caused by an interface of two fluids with different densities.
! The case has been adopted from one created by Prof. Emilie Marchandise, Universite catholique de Louvain.
!
! The are two choices how to advect the levelset function: either differential equation based (Solver 1)
! or semi-lagrangian particle advector (Solver 2). Only one of these should be active. 
! To run the case increase mesh density, number of timesteps and activate the VTU output.
