! This is a working case for a FourierLosses solver.
! The idea of the solver is to make a Fourier decomposition on-the-fly
! and when the integration cycle has ended compute the losses
! given the loss coefficient for each component. The target field
! may be operated by different operators {none,abs,grad,curl} and the 
! resulting field may be taken to any power.
!
! So far the initial field is initiated by a sinusoidally varying  
! potential field but the idea is to apply it to something more physical.
