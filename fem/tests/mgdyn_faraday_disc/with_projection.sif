! This is a simple verification case to check that a Faraday disc creates
! the expected potential difference between the rim and and the axis.
! As explained in the following, this case is also instructive to understand 
! how Elmer treats Maxwell's equations in the case of a moving body.
!
! NOTE: The basic sif file of this case is faraday_disc.sif. This sif file is 
! an alternate where the vector potential variable is made unique in an iterated
! manner (the nonlinear iteration is employed for this purpose) by performing 
! the Helmholtz projection after solving the A-V solution candidate. Now the
! same iterated gauge condition can also be obtained with the input file
! faraday_disc.sif by using the keyword "Helmholtz Projection".
!
! Here a metallic disc rotates and is subject to a uniform magnetic field 
! parallel to the disc axis. When the disc is put to rotate, the mobile charges
! of the conductor start to feel a radial force due to the Lorentz term v x B
! and hence accumulate on the insulated rim surface. As a consequence of charge
! separation a radial electric field E is produced. The process of charge 
! separation continues as long as steady state is reached such that the force on
! the charges which is produced by the Lorentz term v x B balances the force 
! which is produced by E. That is, in the steady state we have 
! 
!               E'(x) = E(x) + v(x) x B(x) = 0, 
!
! with E'(x) being the spatial field that describes the force experienced by 
! a charge (see Elmer Models Manual for Maxwell's equations in terms of E'). 
! Note that the solution is expressed in the spatial coordinates and attention 
! is not fixed on particular material points (this is known as the Euler 
! description in the continuum mechanics).  
!
! The potential difference between the centre and the rim is known to be 
! 1/2 w a^2 |B|, where a is the radius of the disc and w is the angular 
! velocity. Elmer generates E'(x) as the electric field variable and we expect 
! to obtain E' = 0 up to the discretization error.
