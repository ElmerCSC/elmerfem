! Simple case for testing the stranded coil in transient 3D simulation.
! This case is the first ever to use the coil solver to connect a full
! coil to circuits. The wire density vector is given via wire vector instead 
! of wire potential using "Coil Use W Vector = Logical True" keyword in 
! the component section. Why this option? -You can compute your wires 
! in a full coil without cuts which you cannot do using wire potential.
