! Test case for contact with friction coefficient defined.
! It is assumed that a blunt object is pressed to the surface and
! the tangential forces are proportional to the normal forces.
!
! There seems to be some convergence issues for the nonlinear system
! already at dy=-0.3 so a value dy=-0.2 was chosen for this test case. 
! Also higher friction coefficient may cause additional challenges.
!
! This case includes also the effects of frictional heating. 
! A nodal heat source is used. It is obtained from nodal tangential force
! multiplied by velocity. A conditional thermal contact is added between
! the blunt object and the base.
