!---------------------------------------------------------
! Test case for the consistency of partitioning.
! This case is partitoned exactly using Metis partitioning
! into 8 partitions. The number of 
! partitions can not be freely chosen here.
!
! This case additionally includes connected elements that are partitioned to
! partition 1.
