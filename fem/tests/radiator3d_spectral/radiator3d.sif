! Test case for radiatior heat sources & spectral radiosity
! - four radiators within a box
! - temperature registered at four locations outside
! - test comes with and without "diffuse grey" radiation (this is with)
! - this one uses alternative explicit way to compute radiation i.e. radiosity
! - this one with spectral radiosity model
