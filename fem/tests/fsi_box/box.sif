! a test case which demonstrates how a constant compressibility field
! may be optimally scaled so that the convergence of an FSI iteration
! is optimal even in an nonlinear case where the compressibility 
! as a function of displacement is no longer constant. 
! 
! To study the case activate the output and run some more timestep 
! intervals.
