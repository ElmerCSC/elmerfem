! This is test case for static GCR coupled fluid-structure-interaction
!
! A "shoebox" with an elastic lid is being pressed with a force that causes
! the box to shrink in size. As an effect there is a counterforce due to ideal
! gas acting as a spring to the other direction.
!
! The static ideal gas is implemented as a suitable choice of coefficient in ModelPDE.
! For the elasticity equation a plate solver is solved in static mode.
