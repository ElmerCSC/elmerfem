! Test case for automated computation of boundary loads for each 
! boundary. This is the most efficient way to compute fluxes when
! it is possible. There are limitations related to cases where
! nodes are shared between different boundaries. In such a case the 
! procedure cannot separate between the fluxes on that node from 
! different boundaries.
!
! Compared to test case "BoundaryFluxes" this hand-pics the flux to 
! compute. The effect of neighbouring BCs may be omitted since they
! are natural BCs and by construction have zero flux. 
! 
! Similar procedure would be available through "Calculate Loads" and
! summing of nodal loads through "boundary sum" operator of SaveScalars.
! This one sweep operation is somewhat easier to use.
