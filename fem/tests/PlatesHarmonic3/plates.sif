! Solves the plate equation that is assembled as it was a transient one
! and the system is enforced to be harmonic only after the assembly.
! For this purpose a new matrix with double size is created.
! This matrix is by default solved as a complex system. 
!
! Compared to the base version this solves the system as real one. 
!
! Also the system utilizes block solution strategy. I.e. the system is
! first transformed from 3x3 matrix to 6x6 matrix and this is treated as
! a block matrix such that each component is solved separately in Gauss-Seidel
! fashion.
