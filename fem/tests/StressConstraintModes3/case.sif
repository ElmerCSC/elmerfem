!------------------------------------------------
! Test case for constraint modes in 2D elasticity
! Here each node at the lumped surface is treated a
! independent constraint dof.
!
! This is quite simuilar to "StressConstraintModes" except
! the geometry is a cube and here also Craig-Bampton model 
! reduction is applied afterwards.
