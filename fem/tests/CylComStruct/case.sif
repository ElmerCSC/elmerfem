! Test on the effect of internal pressure on elastic cylinder.
! Structured 3D mesh.
!
!
! Reference results, mesh and the problem setting all benchmark from 
! Code_Aster documentation. For complete original documentation see
! http://www.code-aster.org/V2/doc/v10/en/man_v/v3/v3.06.100.pdf
!
! The results between Elmer and Aster differ very little here. 
! Aster seems to suffer a bit less from locking, propably due to
! beneficial approximations. Using higher p- elements counters 
! this problem effectively.
! 
! As in _Aster, axisymmetric presentation allows more accuracy
! at a significantly lower computational expense.
!
! See also "CylComAxi", the same case with an axisymmetric 2D
! mesh.
