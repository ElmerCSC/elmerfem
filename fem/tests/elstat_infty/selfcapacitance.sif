! Computes the self-capacitance of a unit cube. Only 1/8 of the cube is
! modeled. The cube is placed within a larger cube and at the external
! walls infinite field approximation around origin is enforced. This
! makes it possible not to extent the mesh into infinity. Note that 
! this approximation is valied only in 3D. Permittivity of vacuum is set
! to one to allow easier interpretation of the computed capacitance. 
! 
! As the capacitance is 1.02213 the true capacitance is something like 
! 1.02213*8*eps. This is within 2% of the exact solution. 
! Increasing mesh density and taking the outer cube further apart.
! will improve on the accuracy.
