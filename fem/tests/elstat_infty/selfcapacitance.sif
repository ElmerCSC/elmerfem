! Computes the self-capacitance of a unit cube. Only 1/8 of the cube is
! modeled. The cube is placed within a larger cube and at the external
! walls infinite field approximation around origin is enforced. This
! makes it possible not to extent the mesh into infinity. Note that
! this approximation is valid only in 3D. Permittivity of vacuum is set
! to one to allow easier interpretation of the computed capacitance.
!
! As the capacitance is 1.02213 the true capacitance is something like
! 1.02213*8*eps. This is within 2% of the exact solution.
! Increasing mesh density and taking the outer cube further apart.
! will improve on the accuracy.
