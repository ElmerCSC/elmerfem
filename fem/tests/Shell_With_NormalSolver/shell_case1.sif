! Solve nonlinear shell equations of Reissner-Naghdi type when the shell 
! solver reads the director data as an ordinary Elmer solver variable. This
! case can also be run in parallel, while parallel execution is not currently
! possible if the data file format mesh.director or mesh.elements.data is used
! to specify the director (currently there is no parallel file formats for these
! files). 
!
! This case employs a slightly modified version of the solver NormalSolver
! (the source code is contained in CylinderNormalSolver.F90).
! The original mesh files located in the mesh directory give nodes which are on
! a cylindrical surface. The known relation between the global coordinates and
! the director vector is used to solve the Elmer variable 'Director' that
! represents the shell director data.
!
! A cylindrical benchmark problem with membrane-dominated asymptotic behaviour 
! in the linear regime is solved. The linearized problem has been described in 
! Pitkäranta et al. Shell deformation states and the finite element method: 
! a benchmark study of cylindrical shells. Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics
! and Engineering 1995. 128:81-121. Here the shell is subject to a moderate 
! load so that nonlinear effects start to be significant.
