! Test on the effect of hydrostatic pressure on an elastic steel tank.
! 
!
!
! Reference results, mesh and the problem setting all benchmark from 
! Code_Aster documentation. For complete original documentation see
! http://www.code-aster.org/V2/doc/default/en/man_u/u1/u1.05.00.pdf
!
! The reference results are not applicable, Code_Aster produces a 
! different systematic error to the calculation, so the results
! are not really comparable for test purposes.
!
! Homewer it does give feedback on the overall precision of Elmer.
