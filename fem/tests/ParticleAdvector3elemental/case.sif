! Test case for the ParticleAdvector 
! Uses particle-specific timestep that strives to constant Courant number.
! This should optimize the accuracy in a FE mesh. As advected field is 
! "Srides" which demonstrates well how advection takes place without 
! any diffusion. 
!
! This cases uses elemental fields which is more robust because no particle will
! start from the boundary.
