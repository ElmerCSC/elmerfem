! A plate with different temperatures on its sides is bent due to
! thermal expansion. Due to symmetry, we only model one half of the
! square plate, unlike in the benchmark.
!
! Reference results, mesh and the problem setting all benchmark from 
! Code_Aster documentation. For complete original documentation see
! http://www.code-aster.org/V2/doc/v11/en/man_v/v3/v3.02.116.pdf
!
! The results between Elmer and Aster differ a little. 
! Aster seems to suffer a bit less from locking, propably due to
! beneficial approximations. Using higher p- elements counters 
! this problem.
