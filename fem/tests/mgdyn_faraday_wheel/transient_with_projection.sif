! This is a special transient model of the Faraday wheel to test the mortar FE 
! approximation. To this end the wheel is artificially broken into an inner part
! and outer part which are meshed independently. Moreover, the vector potential
! variable is made unique in an iterated manner (the nonlinear iteration is 
! employed for this purpose) by performing the Helmholtz projection after 
! solving the A-V solution candidate. Here this is activated by using the 
! command "Helmholtz Projection = True". For a similar verification case see 
! the test ../mgdyn_faraday_disc_transient/.
!
! Here a metallic wheel rotates and is subject to a magnetic field parallel to 
! the wheel axis (here we generate the magnetic field by prescribing the vector
! potential on boundaries). When the wheel is put to rotate, the mobile charges
! of the conductor start to feel a radial force due to the Lorentz term v x B
! and hence accumulate on the insulated rim surface. As a consequence of charge
! separation a radial electric field E is produced. The process of charge 
! separation continues as long as steady state is reached such that the force on
! the charges which is produced by the Lorentz term v x B balances the force 
! which is produced by E. That is, in the steady state we have 
! 
!               E'(x) = E(x) + v(x) x B(x) = 0, 
!
! with E'(x) being the spatial field that describes the force experienced by 
! a charge (see Elmer Models Manual for Maxwell's equations in terms of E').
! 
! Here the rotation is modelled by mapping the mesh at the previous time into
! the current configuration, so the (mesh) velocity corresponds to the velocity
! field as recorded by an observer at rest (the frame with respect to which the
! node coordinates are calculated). The spatial discretization is thus done over
! an instantaneous configuration. It should be noted that the scalar potential 
! variable V of the model is related to the standard E field via
!
!              E = -grad(psi),   with psi = V + v.A,
!
! where A is the vector potential and v is the velocity, respectively. Note also
! that the solution is expressed in the spatial coordinates and attention 
! is not fixed on particular material points (this is known as the Euler 
! description in the continuum mechanics).
!
! The continuity of the A-V solution is enforced weakly over the artificial 
! contact surface of the inner and outer part.
