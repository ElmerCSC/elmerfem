! Solve the mixed formulation of the Poisson equation by using div-conforming
! (face) finite elements. Here brick elements are used. 
!
! This test is used to check that mixed boundary conditions (the flux and 
! the scalar field specified on complementary parts of the boundary) are
! handled correctly.
