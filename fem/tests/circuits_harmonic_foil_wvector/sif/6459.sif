! Circuits and dynamics test case with foil winding.
! This test case uses the elemental W Vector as the test function 
! and the elemental J Vector as the source field. These fields 
! are computed in WPotentialSolver and their divergence is imposed
! zero elementally in WVectorFix. Using this arrangement the source 
! component should be divergence free even if some divergence would 
! be generated in creating W and J vectors. In this case it seems 
! though that the divergence is fine even before the fix.
! Notice the key words using J Vector
! Solver 4 :: Compute J Vector = Logical True 
! Component 1 :: Foil Winding Use J Vector = Logical True
! In addition if when you use W Vector you need to define
! Component 1 :: Coil Use W Vector = Logical True
! if J Vector and W Vector are used then source term is of the form (J Vector, W Vector)
! if only J Vector is used then (J Vector, grad w)
! if only W Vector is used then (C W Vector, W Vector)
! When neither are used then (C grad w, grad w)
