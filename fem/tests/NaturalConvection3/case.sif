! This test case demonstrates the use of nonlinear timestepping
! with cranck nicolsen. You may try to commit out the "nonlinear timestepping" 
! and notice significant worsening in convergence. 
!
! Here instead of using Boussinesq approximation the linear thermal law
! for flow is used. 
!
! Test case added because user problems on forum
