! Temperature distribution of a simple rectangular object 
! Create the mesh with: ElmerGrid 1 2 winkel.grd
!
! This is derived from a cononical benchmark test with the 
! simplest 3D rectangular structure. 
!
! This base case is solved with CG and partitioned with the 
! Kway algorithm of Metis using dual graph.
