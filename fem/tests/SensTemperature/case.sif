! Computes the sensitivity of temperature to a change in shape.
! The top wall of a geometric shape is moved using rigid mesh
! mapper with smooth transition. The derivative is computed numerically
! using the steady state iteration loop. Exactly two iterations 
! are used. The user should himself take care that the differential
! is divided by the correct value. Here the $mesheps.
