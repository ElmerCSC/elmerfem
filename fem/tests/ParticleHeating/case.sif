! In this example a light source describes by statistical photons being reflected
! and absorbed heats up a complex 2D geometry. For convenience the speed of light
! is set to one and the time is scaled accordingly. Still the heat equation is 
! solved in steady state as there is no heat capacity.
!
! In the current case the particles are sent evenly in 2D space since the initailization
! methods using random numbers differ on different platforms.
