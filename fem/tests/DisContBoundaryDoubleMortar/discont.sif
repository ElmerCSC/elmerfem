! Testing for the discontinuous boundary creation.
! This test case has Delaunay triangularization which requires 
! some special tricks compared to structured meshes. This is due 
! to the single nodes on the boundary.
!
! This case has demonstrates also how to create two different boundaries and
! use mortar condition to ensure continuity of the solution. The other
! boundary does not need to be created.
