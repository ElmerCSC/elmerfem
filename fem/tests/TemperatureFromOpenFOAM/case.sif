! Test case for OpenFOAM2Elmer coupling via file I/O.
!
! OpenFOAM is assumed to write cell centers into a file "C" for each
! multi or single block mesh directory and the corresponding temperature
! to file "T".
!
! Elmer uses the cell centers as data points and heat conductivity as
! regularization to fit the data.
