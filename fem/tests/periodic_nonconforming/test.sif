! This test "misuses" periodicity to make computations in a nonconforming mesh
! Note that this can work in parallel only if all the nonconforming nodes
! are in the same partition. Nor should one be optimistic on using direct
! solvers once the mesh structure has been spoiled by the additional
! connections.
