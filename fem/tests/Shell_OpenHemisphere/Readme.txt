Solve nonlinear shell equations of Reissner-Naghdi type in the case of 
a benchmark problem where an open hemispherical shell is subject to point
loads. The reference results can be found in Sze KY, Liu XH, Lo SH. Popular 
benchmark problems for geometric nonlinear analysis of shells. Finite Elements 
in Analysis and Design 2004, 40(11):1551-1569.
