! This is a verification case of an electromagnetic port model to obtain
! a propagation parameter. A waveguide having a rectangular cross section of
! size a x 2a and consisting of two materials is modelled. This problem has been
! discussed for example in
!
! [ZR18] A. Zdunek and W. Rachowicz. Inhomogeneous lossy waveguide mode
!        analysis. Computers & Mathematics with Applications, 75(3):798-808,
!        2018.
!
! Here a dimensionless form of the model is used. The four eigenvalues having
! the smallest real part give the following values for a scaled propagation
! parameter (see [ZR18])
!
!            1.27576
!            0.97156
!            0.72854
!            0.59390
!
! which are in good agreement with the results given in the literature.
