! A test case for mortar BCs in a case when there is hierarchically coupled
! Navier-Stokes and heat equations. It is assumed that we have an airgap
! between rotating "rotor" at the inside and "stator" at the outside.
!
! In between there is a rotationally symmetric interface where continuity
! should be achieved with mortar BCs. Only a quarter of the symmetry is
! modelled which results to two additional mortar BCs.
!
! The periodic BCs for Navier-Stokes are only set for pressure since
! for velocity is not continuous component-wise. For the N-T system we use
! "rotational normals" which are easily consistent between stator and rotor.
!
! In each timestep the temperature and nodal heat fluxes are averaged
! and also lumped fluxes are computed.
