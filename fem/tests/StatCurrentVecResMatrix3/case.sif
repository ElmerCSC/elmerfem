! Test for the vectorized StatCurrent solver
! Includes some matrix computation using constrained modes.
!
! Variation of the primary in that the we apply 0/1 rhs body force and
! register the rection terms that are line integrals over the bodies.
! This is a little like flux linkage but does not really make sense
! physically in this context. However, the test provides a consistency
! test for the machinery.
