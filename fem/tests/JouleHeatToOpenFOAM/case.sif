! Test case for Elmer2OpenFOAM coupling via file I/O.
!
! OpenFOAM is assumed to write cell centers into a file "C" for each
! multi or single block mesh directory. Elmer projects the requested field
! to those points and writes the source terms for OpenFOAM to use.
!
! This case is just simple static current conduction case where Joule heating
! is used as a source term in consecutive OpenFOAM simulations.
! Here only minimal OpenFOAM file structure is used.
