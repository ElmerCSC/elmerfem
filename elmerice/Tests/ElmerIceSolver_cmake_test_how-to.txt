ElmerIce Solver cmake test case "How-to"
========================================

Adapted from ElmerSolver_cmake_test-how-to.txt (J. Kataja)

This How-to describes how to create and use test cases in software
development and case definition.

The test cases are used to check for possible bugs, and to ensure 
backward compatibility. For that purpose they are currently around 
39 repertories (Jan 2016) . The tests should be located in directory

[TRUNK]/elmerice/Tests

To run the test-cases, compile Elmer, go to the build repertory and run:
	ctest -L elmerice   (all Elmer/Ice tests)
	ctest -L elmerice-fast   (all fast Elmer/Ice tests)
	ctest -L slow   (all slow Elmer/Ice tests)
	ctest -R <TestName> (all tests matching expression)


B. How to create a test
=======================

When a new feature has been verified it is often a good idea to
create a test case that ensures the feature will be maintained
also in the future versions of Elmer. To do this:

1) Create new directory in the "tests" directory under [TRUNK]/elmerice.
   The folders in this directory will be automatically scanned and
   tests run.

2) Define your analysis: .sif file, mesh files, F90 files &
   ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO 

      In order to test a norm resulting from a solver <N>,
      add those lines at the end of .sif file:
	*** CODE ***
	Solver N :: Reference Norm = Real <norm>
	Solver N :: Reference Norm Tolerance = Real <tol>
	$fprintf( stderr, "TEST CASE 1\n");
	RUN
	$fprintf( stderr, "END TEST CASE 1: Target NRM=<norm>,EPS=<tol>\n" );
	************

      Equivalent to those lines inside the solver block to be tested

	*** CODE ***
	Reference Norm = real <norm>
	Reference Norm Tolerance = Real <tol>
	************

3) Create CMakeLists.txt file in the test directory containing
	*** CODE ***
	INCLUDE(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../test_macros.cmake)
	CONFIGURE_FILE(<sif_name>.sif <sif_name>.sif COPYONLY)
	ADD_ELMERICETEST_MODULE(<test_name> <module_name> <module_source.f90>)
	FILE(COPY ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO <file1> <file2> <directory1> ...DESTINATION "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/")
	ADD_ELMERICE_TEST(<test_name>)
	ADD_ELMERICE_LABEL(<test_name> <label>)
	************
    For label, 
  test < 10s, <label>=elmerice-fast
  test > 100s, <label>=slow

4) Create runTest.cmake with
	*** CODE ***
	INCLUDE(${TEST_SOURCE}/../test_macros.cmake)
	EXECUTE_PROCESS(COMMAND <command_name> <arg1> <arg2> ...)
	RUN_ELMERICE_TEST()
	************


C. Results 
============
	On screen
	---------
Run the tests will print some informations for each test-case. For example:
      Start  1: Teterousse3a
 1/36 Test  #1: Teterousse3a .....................***Passed    503.64 sec
      Start  2: Dating
 2/36 Test  #2: Dating ...........................***Passed    2.73 sec

        In directory build/elmerice/Testing/Temporary/
	----------------------------------------------
LastTest.log with all the details about the tests and
LastTestsFailed.log with the list of failed tests. 


D. How to use the test case as starting point
==============================================

One can take these tests as a starting point or copy-paste
appropriate solver sections from there. These tests do not include
any ElmerGUI project file and therefore the graphical user interface
cannot be used to view these cases. You can look at the README.txt in
each test to see what sequence of command is usually needed.
