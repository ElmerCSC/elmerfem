## General Description
This solver computes the flow of snow/firn material (i.e., porous incompressible ice) using the snow/firn law proposed by Gagliardini and Meyssonnier (1997). The snow/ice rheological law is function of the relative density, which is a required input variable for this solver. The law depends on two function, a(D) and b(D), which are parametrized functions of the relative density D.

As optional output variables, strain-rate, deviatoric stress and spin can be calculated. In this solver, the nodal value of these quantities is computed as the average contribution from all the elements belonging at this given node. This can be slightly different than the evaluation obtained using the variational method (as in the [Strain-rate solver](./ComputeStrainRate.md) and the [ComputeDevStress](./ComputeDevStress.md) solver).

More details about the snow/firn law can be found here: [poroussolver.pdf](./poroussolver.pdf).

2024-01-23: The [ComputeDevStress](./ComputeDevStress.md) solver is now compatible with the Porous Solver. Using the latter is usually preferable than computing deviatoric stress directly in the Porous Solver. A New module PorousMaterialModels has been added in the Utils directory. It computes the effective viscosity and compressibility parameter to avoid code duplication (transparent for the user).
Note that for pure ice, functions a(D) and b(D) must be set to 1 and 0, respectively. In the previous solver version, the test to apply these limit values was: if $D \geq 1$. This was prone to give outlier values of stresses at some nodes. The test has therefore been replaced by: if $D > 0.99\_DP$. This can very slightly affect the obtained solution field. The reference norm of the DGsolver test has been adapted accordingly.
