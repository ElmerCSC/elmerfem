# R Gladstone Note: a choice of two commands for compilation is given above (CSC specific).  The second one probably 
# works better, but you should load modules in the following order before compiling:
#module load elmer/latest
#module load netcdf


#Joe Todd Note: I found that, on systems other than the CSC Cray machines, it was important to specify
#the source file before the library/include flags, or else at runtime you get 'undefined symbol' errors.
# So (assuming default lib and inc locations):

# elmerf90 GridDataReader.F90 -I/usr/include -L/usr/lib -lnetcdff -o GridDataReader.so
