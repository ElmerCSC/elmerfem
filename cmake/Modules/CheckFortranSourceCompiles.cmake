# CheckFortranSourceCompiles
# Derived (with some modifications) from a CMake patch to the 
# upcoming version 3.1. To be removed from the Elmer distribution 
# as soon as CMake version 3.1 is widely available
#
# - Check if given C source compiles and links into an executable
# CHECK_Fortran_SOURCE_COMPILES(<code> <var> [FAIL_REGEX <fail-regex>])
#  <code>       - source code to try to compile, must define 'main'
#  <var>        - variable to store whether the source code compiled
#  <fail-regex> - fail if test output matches this regex
# The following variables may be set before calling this macro to
# modify the way the check is run:
#
#  CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
#  CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
#  CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
#  CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
