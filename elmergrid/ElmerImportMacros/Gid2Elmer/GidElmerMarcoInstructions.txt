Instructions for importing meshes into Elmer from GiD
=====================================================

Note: these procedures have been originally written long ago and may not work with the current version of GiD. 

It is possible to use GiD as a pre processor and mesh generator for Elmer in 2d and 3d analysis. 

Copy the folder elmer.gid under in GiD's problem type folder \GiD\Problemtypes. The folder contains all necessary templates GiD to run under linux- and windows (and possibly Mac) platforms. It may be that the directory also includes the binaries, if not you should compile them from the source codes to stand-alone executables. 


Update from Mark Smith in 2014: The updated Elmer problem type for GiD which now handles prism and pyramid elements, though not extensively tested it seems to do the job on windows.
Included are the original files : findparents.f90.orig and Elmer.bas.orig. (note that the mac type has not been updated).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Make sure that the folder elmer.gid is copied in \GiD\ProblemTypes.
   Then, "elmer" should be a valid problem type for GiD and visible in
   Data -> Problem type.

2) Invoke GiD and choose File -> New 

3) Create a square: Geometry -> Create -> Object -> Rectangle. Give:

       First corner point: 0 0
       Second corner point: 1 1

4) Right-click the mouse and choose a) Render -> Flat lighting b) Rotate ->
   Trackball. Select a nice view point and give the command "zoom frame".

5) Choose Data -> Problem type -> elmer

6) Assing boundary conditions to the boundary lines by choosing Data -> 
   Condition. Select "LineCondition" with Index=1 and assign it to all four
   boundary lines of the rectangle. NOTE: Only the boundary elements with
   Index>0 will be written in the mesh file "mesh.boundary".

7) Choose Data -> Materials and assign Index=1 to the surface of the
   rectangle. NOTE: Only the bulk elements with material Index>0 will be
   written in the mesh file "mesh.elements".

8) Set Utilities -> Preferences -> Meshing -> Mesh always by default: lines
   This option is needed to generate the mesh.boundary file.

9) Select Meshing -> Generate. Give size=0.14. As a result, we should
   get 28 linear boundary elements, 104 triangular bulk elements, and 67
   nodes.

10) Save the project: File -> Save as. 

11) Save the mesh in elmer-format by choosing Calculate -> Calculate. The
    mesh.* files written by GiD can be found from the project-folder.
