HUTIter iterative solver

The build system is a cross-over from a home-brewed preprocessed
system and a GNU automake system. src/*.src contain the code
itself. This is then preprocessed into several different precisions:
(single, double, single complex, and double complex).

Older versions of autoconf don't come with f90 support, so you should
have atleast >=2.59
